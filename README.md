<h1 align="center">Machine Learning Application Development using Streamlit</h1>

This project is a part of streamlit app development and deployment. The primary objective is to build web application and deploy it to the cloud environment so that it will enable many users to access the application. The algorithm used in this project is to predict the annual salary of a software engineer, the machine learning model could be developed further in another phrase for better accuracy and precision.
