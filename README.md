<h1 align="center">Machine Learning Application Development using Python Streamlit</h1>

This project is a part of streamlit app development and deployment. The primary objective is to build web application and deploy it to the cloud environment so that it will enable access to many end users. The algorithm used in this project is to predict the annual salary of a software engineer, though the machine learning model could be developed further in another phrase for better accuracy and precision.

The open source dataset being used in training the models could be found on https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

Python Packages: Pandas, Sklearn
Algorithm: LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor
Optimization: GridSearchCV
Metrics: mean squared error, mean absolute error
